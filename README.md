This project aims to build a simple version of the Airbnb application.
The first step is to create a command line interpreter(console): Which will allow us to:
        1. Create our data model
        2. Manage (create, update, destroy, etc) objects via console/
           command interpreter
        3. Store & persist objects to a JSON file
