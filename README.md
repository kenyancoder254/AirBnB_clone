The aim of this project is to write a simple version of the aribnb appliation.
The first step is to create a commandline interpreter(console): Which will allow us to:
        1. Create our data model
        2. Manage (create, update, destroy, etc) objects via console/
           command interpreter
        3. Store & persist objects to a JSON file
